# Moscow Time Zone Application

## Description
This application is a simple Python application that returns the current time in Moscow. 

## Features
- Displays the current time in Moscow

## Justification for Framework of Choice

I chose Flask because it is a lightweight framework that is easy to use and has a simple syntax. It is also easy to set up and has a built-in development server and debugger. Also, it has a great community. Moreover, I have experience with other frameworks such as Django, and I wanted to try something new.

## Usage

To use this application, simply run the following commands:

```bash
# Make sure you are in the app_python directory
cd app_python

# Check if you have Python installed
python --version

# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
flask run

# For debug mode: 
flask run --debug
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/ to see the current time in Moscow.
