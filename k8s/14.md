# Lab 14: Kubernetes Monitoring and Init Containers

### Components of the Kube Prometheus Stack

1. **The Prometheus Operator**: It makes the deployment and management of Prometheus and related monitoring components within Kubernetes clusters easier. It utilizes Kubernetes custome resourses to define and manage Prometheus, Alertmanager etc.
2. **Alert Manager**: It handles alerts generated by client applications like Prometheus within the k8s ecosystem. It can handle alert deduplication, grouping and routing, too.
3. **Node exporter**: It collects hardware metrics (also OS metrics) from kernel. It makes these metrics available on HTTP endpoints that can be scraped. 
4. **Blackbox Exporter**: It allows Prometheus to check different endpoints for monitoring and checking the health of external services. 
5. **Prometheus Adapter for Kubernetes Metrics API**: It works like a connection betweek Kubernetes and Prometheus. It allows to use metrics from Prometheus to apply auto-scaling of pods. 
6. **Grafana**: It's a monitoring tool; it gives us visuals (graphs/charts etc.). It can be used as the main source of dashboards. 
7. **Prometheus**: It allows to collect time-based data and metrics at regular intervals. It can help us get some insights about the performance of our system.
